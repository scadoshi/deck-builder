// # 404 Not Found
// ## Justification
// At this point in the project, ports and services for this domain entity are not required.
// This is because all of the auth that I need at the moment is for the user domain entity to be able to perform basic registration and authentication.
//
// You can find those in the ports and services files of the user domain entity. Thank you.
